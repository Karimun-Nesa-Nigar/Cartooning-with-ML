# Cartooning-with-ML
In the era of modern technology , computer vision achieved a great success. IMAGE PROCESSING is a core part of computer vision which helps us transform and manipulate images and extract information from them. This information is stored in the form of data.
Python is one of the widely used programming languages for this purpose since it has many libraries which can directly be used to pre-process images efficiently. Using Python programming we can use a few computer vision libraries.
For this project we use Python libraries like OpenCV, NumPy.
The basic concept of this project is to convert RGB into its accurate, cartoon image with multiple filtrations or blurred image with proper edge detection


# Approach
We propose to use neural style transfer which is a machine learning algorithm, which involves two images, first is the input 
image from the user and second is the style image which is used to apply the style on the input image.
To run this project, we need the 64bit system and we need to install Pycharm of recent version software. After installing the software, we need to install following libraries
 i- Pip install NumPy. ii - Pip install open cv2


# Result
The process to create a cartoon effect image can be initially branched into 2 divisions â€“ 1) To detect, blur and bold the edges of the actual RGB color image. 2) To smooth, quantize and the conversion of the RGB image to grayscale. The results involved in combining the image and help achieve the desired result which are:
1 Identifying the Edges
Colors to the RGB
